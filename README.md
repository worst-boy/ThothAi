# Thoth AI - A Telegram AI Bot for Multiple Personas

#### Video Demo: <URL HERE>

## Introduction

Thoth AI is a versatile and intelligent Telegram bot designed to assist users with a range of needs. Whether you're looking for mental health guidance from a therapist, financial advice, career coaching, or learning mentorship, Thoth AI provides expert-level conversations across multiple personas. The bot leverages the **Gemini-1.0-Pro** API from Googleâ€™s generative AI services to deliver high-quality, human-like responses.

## Features

- **Therapist**: Provides empathetic, therapeutic support based on user input.
- **Doctor**: Gives accurate and professional medical advice.
- **Financial Advisor**: Offers guidance on personal finance and investment strategies.
- **Career Coach**: Helps users navigate their career paths with personalized advice.
- **Learning Mentor**: Provides learning strategies and study techniques to boost productivity.

## How It Works

The bot allows users to select different personas via inline keyboard buttons. Once a persona is selected, the bot will adopt the corresponding personality and respond accordingly based on user queries. This is achieved through pre-configured persona instruction prompts that guide the AI responses.

## Technologies Used

- **Telegram Bot API**: To handle messaging and bot interaction ([API Docs](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api)).

- **Python**: The core programming language used for scripting the bot ([Python Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).
- **Telebot**: A Python wrapper for working with the Telegram Bot API ([Telebot Docs](https://pytba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)).
- **Google Generative AI Library**: For integrating the Gemini API ([PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/google-generativeai/)).
